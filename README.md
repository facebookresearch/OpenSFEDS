# OpenSFEDS dataset

The OpenSFEDS dataset (Open Sensor Fusion Eyes Data Set) is a novel dataset of 2.25M synthetic, time-synchronized eye-image pairs captured using a simulated RGB camera (640 x 480 px) and a set of 16 simulated photosensors placed on an on-axis sensor grid. The dataset has been created using a simulation framework based on UnityEyes, allowing for the synthesis of wide subjects’ appearance, illumination, and camera position variability. 
The dataset includes two subsets:
- OpenSFEDS-Static: 450K independent image pairs, with uniform gaze distribution covering ±25◦ of visual angle.
- OpenSFEDS-Temporal: 1.8K, 2s sequences of image pairs at 500 Hz with gaze extracted from real eye movement traces of the GazeBase dataset, featuring smooth pursuits, fixations, and saccades.
